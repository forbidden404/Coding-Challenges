### 5. Sum Lists 

You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Write a function that ads the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

Follow-up: Suppose the digits are stored in forward order. Repeat the above problem.
