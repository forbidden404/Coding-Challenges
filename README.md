# Coding Challenges

Coding Challenges is a repository where I will be keeping track of the coding questions I do or the concepts I learn, or have learned already. The main motivation of creating this repo is to gather all the code that has been spread throughout my folders that serve the same purpose.

## Getting Started

The project folder is structured in the following way, there will be a folder for each coding website if it exists, or else based on its concept, inside each folder there will be a folder for each question/concept, containing the solution code primarily in C++11 and maybe in other languages, given input and expected output if necessary.

## Compiling
### C
```bash
$ make main
```

### C++
```bash
$ make main CPPFLAGS="-std=c++11"
```

### Haskell
```bash
$ ghc main.hs
```

### Swift
```bash
$ swiftc main.swift
```

### Rust
```bash
$ rustc main.rs
```

## Testing 
```bash
$ ./main < input > output2
$ diff output output2
```
