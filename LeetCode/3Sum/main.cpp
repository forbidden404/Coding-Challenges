// This problem is an evolution to the Two Sum we have done earlier, but in this
// case, since we have to check 3 numbers, we need to have one fixed point while we
// check the other two elements to find our triplets. That way the complexity will be
// at least O(n^2), but we can't do any better unless we use really obscure algorithms 
// to improve that. The study of an improvement for the time complexity of 3Sum is a subject
// still being researched in Computer Science so we will keep ourselves to a O(n^2) solution.
// Knowing that, we can sort our array, since this operation will take O(n log n), we don't 
// need to worry about it affecting the overall time complexity. This way we can prevent
// duplicates easily. We just need to fix one point and check if the next two numbers which
// should be equal or bigger than said number are already bigger than 0, so we can't possibly
// find a pair, breaking out of our loop, or if the fixed number plus the last two are smaller
// than 0, so we need to move our fixed point. These optimizations, although small, can help 
// us improve our real time performance. After that we just set a window with two elements at
// the extremes and then we start checking if we arrive in our target, moving our left and right
// accordingly. When we find a triplet, we should also move our left and right until they are in
// a different element they were before, to avoid duplicates.
