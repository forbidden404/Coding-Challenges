### 10. Regular Expression Matching

Given an input string (s) and a pattern (p), implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*'.


'.' Matches any single character.

'*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).


Note:


s could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z.

p could be empty and contains only lowercase letters a-z, and characters like . or *.
